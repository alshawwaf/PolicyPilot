# MCP server — connect PolicyPilot to n8n / an LLM agent

PolicyPilot exposes its access-automation brain as **29 MCP tools** an LLM agent (via n8n's *MCP Client
Tool* node, or any MCP client) can call over a single endpoint, `/mcp`. The tools cover **two rails**:

- **Management access policy** (21 tools) — decide/apply changes on an SMS via the Management web_api
  (correlate a service/app/time/content/limit/access-role/zone/UserCheck/gateway/VPN name, list
  servers/layers, analyze a policy, check Terraform/Ansible coverage, apply, remove, amend, revert).
- **Dynamic Layers** — author an access rulebase and push it straight to a gateway via the Gaia API
  (`set-dynamic-content`), out-of-band of SmartConsole.

Each rail has its **own** publish gate (`mcp_allow_publish` for the management rail, `mcp_allow_layer_push`
for live-gateway pushes — see §4). The two n8n starter agents in `docs/` map one-to-one onto the rails
(see §2).

The tool **logic** ships in `app/services/mcp_tools.py` and is fully tested. The MCP protocol layer uses
the official **`mcp` Python SDK**, which is **not bundled** (org policy: packages come from Artifactory,
not PyPI). Until it's installed the `/mcp` endpoint is simply absent — the rest of the portal is
unaffected.

## 1. Activate

Install the MCP SDK once (it's mounted automatically when present), then set the token from the portal —
no env edit, no redeploy:

```bash
# one-time: install the MCP SDK from your Check Point Artifactory (NOT plain PyPI)
pip install mcp            # via your Artifactory-configured index, then restart PolicyPilot
```

Then create a key in the portal: **Settings → API keys → + New key** (scope **mcp**). The key is shown
**once** — copy it. Clients send it as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. You can mint multiple named keys
(e.g. `n8n-prod`, `my-laptop`), see each one's last-used time, and **revoke** any of them individually and
immediately. Keys are stored **hashed** (SHA-256) — a DB leak exposes no usable key.

Two simpler alternatives also work and take precedence/cascade automatically:
- **Single shared token** — Settings → MCP / agent → "MCP bearer token" (stored encrypted, AES-256-GCM).
- **Env var** `PILOT_MCP_TOKEN` — a fallback for headless/automated deploys.

`/mcp` is **mounted whenever the SDK is installed**; while nothing is configured (no key, no token) it
returns **503**. A request is authorized if its bearer matches **any active MCP key** OR the shared token.
The **MCP for agents** page (`/mcp-guide`) shows live status and links to both. (The ticketing webhook is
the same: a **webhook**-scope API key sent as `X-PolicyPilot-Token`, or the shared webhook token.)

**Self-serve onboarding page:** the portal has a **MCP for agents** page at **`/mcp-guide`** (under
*Layers & Gateways*) — live status pills (SDK installed / endpoint enabled / publish gate), a
connect-config generator with copy-paste snippets for Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code and n8n (built from
the live origin + a bearer token you type in), and the full tool catalog. Same idea as
<https://mcp.checkpoint.com/>. Point teammates there instead of hand-writing config.

**Standalone alternative** (own port, e.g. if you don't want it on the portal): 
```bash
PILOT_MCP_TOKEN=... PILOT_MCP_PORT=8765 python -m app.mcp_server
```

## 1b. REST API (any HTTP client)

Beyond MCP and the webhook, the access-automation brain is exposed as a plain **REST API** at
**`/dbapi/v1`**. Authenticate with an **api**-scope key (Settings → API keys) sent as
`Authorization: Bearer <key>`; no valid key → **401**. It's auto-documented in the portal's OpenAPI
(`/docs`, `/openapi.json`).

```bash
curl -s https://<host>/dbapi/v1/access/decide \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"server_id":1,"source":"10.1.1.5","destination":"Any","service":"https"}'
# -> {"outcome":"create","reason":...}
```

Endpoints (thin wrappers over the same `services.mcp_tools`, so behaviour + safety match MCP exactly).

**Management access policy:**
`GET /dbapi/v1/servers`, `GET /dbapi/v1/layers?server_id=`, `GET /dbapi/v1/layers/summary`,
`GET /dbapi/v1/layers/analyze`, `GET /dbapi/v1/coverage`, `GET /dbapi/v1/conformance` (post-deploy
self-check: surface wired + safe, no live SMS/gateway touched), `POST /dbapi/v1/access/decide`,
`POST /dbapi/v1/access/apply` (publish admin-gated; also the block path — `action=Drop/Reject`), and the
full correlate family
`POST /dbapi/v1/access/correlate/{service,application,time,content,limit,access-role,zone,user-check,gateway,vpn}`.
Each `correlate/*` endpoint takes a body of `{"server_id":1,"name":"dns"}` (a fuzzy name → the matching
Check Point object: a service / application / time / data-type / limit / access-role / security-zone /
UserCheck / gateway / VPN-community object, respectively).

**Dynamic Layers:**
`GET /dbapi/v1/gateways` (the saved push targets), `GET /dbapi/v1/dynamic-layers` (list),
`GET /dbapi/v1/dynamic-layers/get?layer=` (read one layer's rulebase),
`POST /dbapi/v1/dynamic-layers/rule` (add a rule — edit only),
`POST /dbapi/v1/dynamic-layers/rule/remove` (remove a rule by name),
`POST /dbapi/v1/dynamic-layers/push` (push to a gateway — a real-gateway push is admin-gated by
`mcp_allow_layer_push`; `dry_run=true` and `gateway:"mock"` are always allowed).

Each endpoint's exact request schema is also browsable at `/docs`.

## 2. Connect n8n

In the **AI Agent** → add an **MCP Client Tool** node:
- **Endpoint / SSE URL:** `https://<policypilot-host>/mcp` (or `http://<host>:8765` standalone)
- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP (or SSE, depending on your n8n version)
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <mcp-scope key>` (or the shared `PILOT_MCP_TOKEN`)

n8n discovers the tools automatically (`tools/list`). The agent can then call them by name. Both rails
live on the **same** `/mcp` endpoint and the same mcp-scope key — a single MCP Client Tool node sees all
29 tools.

**Starter workflows** — import either of the two ready-made n8n agents from `docs/` (each is one rail with
a tuned system prompt, the MCP Client Tool node, and a chat trigger), then point its credential at your
`/mcp` URL + mcp-scope key:
- **[`docs/policypilot-management-agent.json`](policypilot-management-agent.json)** — the management access
  automation agent (the 21 SMS tools; decide/apply/remove/amend/revert on the management policy).
- **[`docs/policypilot-dynamic-layer-agent.json`](policypilot-dynamic-layer-agent.json)** — the Dynamic
  Layers agent (author a rulebase and push it to a gateway via the Gaia API).

## 3. Tools

29 tools across two rails. The **Writes?** column notes which gate (if any) controls live writes — the two
rails have **separate** gates (see §4).

### Management access policy (21 tools — SMS via the Management web_api)

| Tool | Does | Writes? |
|------|------|---------|
| `list_management_servers` | the saved SMS targets (id/name/host) | no |
| `list_access_layers(server_id)` | the policy layers on a server | no |
| `decide_access(server_id, source, destination, layer, service?/port?/application?, …)` | **preview** the decision (no_op/widen/create/review) + reasoning + suggestions | no |
| `correlate_service(server_id, name)` | service/protocol name → real CP object, or candidates | no |
| `correlate_application(server_id, name)` | app/site name → real CP object, or candidates | no |
| `correlate_time(server_id, name)` | time phrase ("work hours") → CP **time** object for the Time column, or candidates | no |
| `correlate_content(server_id, name)` | content phrase ("SQL Queries") → CP **data-type** for the Content column, or candidates | no |
| `correlate_user_check(server_id, name)` | UserCheck phrase ("the blocked message") → CP **UserCheck** interaction object (Ask/Inform prompt or Drop/Reject block page), or candidates | no |
| `correlate_access_role(server_id, name)` | identity phrase ("the finance role") → CP **access-role** (Identity Awareness) for a zero-trust source, or candidates | no |
| `correlate_zone(server_id, name)` | zone phrase ("DMZ") → CP **security-zone** for a typed source/dest, or candidates | no |
| `correlate_limit(server_id, name)` | bandwidth phrase ("10 Mbps upload") → CP **limit** RATE object for Action Settings, or candidates | no |
| `correlate_gateway(server_id, name)` | gateway phrase ("the perimeter gateway") → CP **gateway/target** for the Install-On column, or candidates | no |
| `correlate_vpn(server_id, name)` | VPN phrase ("the site-to-site community") → CP **VPN community** for the VPN column, or candidates | no |
| `summarize_layer(server_id, layer)` | rule counts, Accept/Drop split, Any-dimension counts, inline layers, cleanup-drop presence | no |
| `analyze_policy(server_id, layer)` | summary + shadowed rules (covered by an earlier broader Accept/Drop) + overly-permissive Accepts | no |
| `coverage_lookup(api, name?, version?)` | object/field support across API / Terraform / Ansible | no |
| `apply_access(server_id, …, action?/content?/time_objects?/install_on?/vpn?/user_check?…, publish)` | create/widen with any access-rule column; `publish=false` **dry-run** (validate + discard); `publish=true` **commit**. **Also the way to _block_** (`action=Drop/Reject`; `service` defaults to `Any` for a serviceless block; add `user_check` for a block message) | gated — `mcp_allow_publish` |
| `remove_access(server_id, …, publish)` | **revoke an existing allow** — disable an exact-grant rule, or drop-above a broader one. *Not* how you block new traffic (that's `apply_access` with `action=Drop`) | gated — `mcp_allow_publish` |
| `amend_access_rule(change_id \| rule_uid+layer, name?/comment?/tags?/track?, publish)` | edit a rule's **metadata only** (name/comment/tags/track-logging) — never its match columns | gated — `mcp_allow_publish` |
| `list_changes(limit?)` | recent **published** changes (id/what/when/reverted?) for audit + undo | no |
| `revert_change(change_id, publish, disable_instead_of_delete?)` | surgically undo one published change (delete/re-enable/restore) | gated — `mcp_allow_publish` |

**Block ≠ remove_access.** To *block* traffic, use `apply_access` with `action=Drop` (or `Reject`) — a
serviceless block passes `service=Any`, and a block that shows a page passes a `user_check` message object.
`remove_access` is only for taking away an **existing** allow (it has no action / service=Any / UserCheck).

The **`correlate_*`** family is pure discovery — each resolves a plain phrase to the real Check Point object
(unique-exact auto-match, else "did you mean" candidates, drift-safe) so the agent names an object that
actually exists before it decides/applies. Time / content / limit / access-role / zone / UserCheck /
gateway / VPN objects are all **reuse-only** (they must already exist on the SMS — the engine never creates
them); on no match, relay the candidates.

`summarize_layer` / `analyze_policy` are read-only and **provably conservative** — `analyze_policy` only
flags a rule as shadowed when it can prove an earlier rule fully covers it under first-match (it abstains
on application-layer / opaque cells rather than guessing), and only flags Accepts that are `Any` on a
whole dimension. Good for an agent to *understand* a policy before proposing a change.

### Dynamic Layers (8 tools — push a rulebase to a gateway via the Gaia API)

| Tool | Does | Writes? |
|------|------|---------|
| `list_gateways` | the saved Gaia gateways a dynamic layer can be pushed to (id/name/host/port) | no |
| `list_dynamic_layers` | the dynamic layers authored in the portal (id/name/target layer/rule count) | no |
| `get_dynamic_layer(layer)` | read one layer (by id or name): target access-layer name + its current rulebase (the **portal copy**) | no |
| `fetch_dynamic_layer(gateway, layer_name?)` | pull the **live** dynamic-layer content currently on a gateway via the Gaia API (incl. policy pushed over the API outside the portal) — fetch before a push, which is a *replace* | no |
| `import_dynamic_layer(gateway, layer_name?, into_layer?)` | save a gateway's **live** layer into a portal layer, so `add_dynamic_rule` + `push_dynamic_layer` replace with **live + your edits** (never wiping external policy) | local edit |
| `add_dynamic_rule(layer, source, destination, service?, action?, name?, position?)` | add a rule to a layer's rulebase — **edits the layer only**, persisted locally; call `push_dynamic_layer` to apply | local edit |
| `remove_dynamic_rule(layer, rule)` | remove a rule by name — edits the layer only (a layer must keep ≥1 rule) | local edit |
| `push_dynamic_layer(layer, gateway?, dry_run?)` | push the layer to a gateway via `set-dynamic-content`. `dry_run=true` validates; blank/`mock` gateway hits the demo target | gated — `mcp_allow_layer_push` |

`add_dynamic_rule` / `remove_dynamic_rule` only mutate the layer **stored in PolicyPilot** — nothing
reaches a gateway until `push_dynamic_layer`. A `push_dynamic_layer` to a **live** gateway is the only
gated write here, and it's gated by `mcp_allow_layer_push` (a **separate** toggle from `mcp_allow_publish`);
a `dry_run=true` push and a push to the built-in `mock` target are **always** allowed.

## 4. Safety model

- **Auth:** every call requires `Authorization: Bearer <key-or-token>` (constant-time checked). Valid
  credentials are any active **MCP API key** (Settings → API keys; hashed at rest, individually revocable)
  or the shared **MCP token** (Settings → MCP / agent, encrypted at rest; `PILOT_MCP_TOKEN` env fallback).
  Nothing configured → **503** (disabled); wrong/missing credential → **401**. A DB read failure fails
  **closed** (endpoint stays disabled / key set treated as empty), never open.
- **No accidental writes:** `decide_access` is read-only; `apply_access` with `publish=false` rehearses
  the change in a session and **discards** it (nothing committed). On the Dynamic Layers rail,
  `add_dynamic_rule` / `remove_dynamic_rule` only edit the layer stored in PolicyPilot — nothing reaches a
  gateway until an explicit `push_dynamic_layer`.
- **Two separate publish gates — each rail is opt-in independently:**
  - **Management rail —** `apply_access(publish=true)`, `remove_access`, `amend_access_rule` and
    `revert_change` only commit when an admin enables **Settings → MCP / agent → "Let the MCP agent
    publish to live policy"** (`mcp_allow_publish`, default OFF). Otherwise the call is refused with a
    message telling the agent to dry-run instead.
  - **Dynamic Layers rail —** `push_dynamic_layer` to a **live** gateway only runs when an admin enables
    **Settings → MCP / agent → "Let the MCP agent push dynamic layers to gateways"**
    (`mcp_allow_layer_push`, default OFF). A `dry_run=true` push and a push to the built-in `mock` target
    are always allowed regardless of the gate.

  The two toggles are **independent** — enabling one does not enable the other, so an LLM cannot reach
  either live target unless you deliberately allow that rail.
- **Read-only keys (per-key RBAC):** an API key is either **read-write** (default) or **read-only**. A
  read-only key can call the read/preview tools (`decide_access`, `fetch_dynamic_layer`, `list_*`,
  `summarize_layer`, `analyze_policy`, …) but **every write tool refuses** (`apply_access`, `remove_access`,
  `amend_access_rule`, `revert_change`, `add`/`remove_dynamic_rule`, `import_dynamic_layer`,
  `push_dynamic_layer`) — over MCP the tool returns a read-only error; over REST the write endpoints return
  **403**; the webhook refuses an `apply=true`. Mint one in **Settings → API keys** (the *Read-only*
  checkbox) to give an agent look-but-don't-touch access. This is independent of, and on top of, the publish
  /push gates.
- **Rate limiting:** the `agent_rate_limit_per_min` setting (Settings → MCP / agent) caps requests **per key
  per minute** across `/mcp`, REST, and the webhook — a backstop against a runaway agent loop. `0` =
  unlimited (default); over the cap returns **HTTP 429** (retry shortly).
- **Idempotent commits:** pass an optional `idempotency_key` (any stable string per logical change) to
  `apply_access` or `push_dynamic_layer`. A retry with the same key **replays** the first committed result
  (`idempotent_replay: true`) instead of publishing/pushing again — so an agent retry, an n8n retry-on-fail,
  or a redelivered ticket webhook can never create a duplicate change. Keys are kept 24h. (Use a deterministic
  key, e.g. the ServiceNow ticket number, so the retry actually matches.)
- **Autopilot** (the `aa_autopilot` toggle, set by the *Autopilot (lab demo)* preset) only affects the
  **management** rail — it lets one sentence resolve, apply **and** publish. It rides on
  `mcp_allow_publish`; it does **not** touch `mcp_allow_layer_push`.
- The engine's own guarantees still apply end-to-end: an unknown/ambiguous service name returns
  `review` + `suggestions` and **never** produces a wrong call to the SMS.

## 5. Example agent loop

> "Allow 10.1.1.222 to reach the DNS servers over DNS."

1. `correlate_service(server_id, "dns")` → confirms the CP service object.
2. `decide_access(server_id, "10.1.1.222", "<dns group>", "Network", service="domain-udp")` → e.g.
   `widen` with the target rule + reasoning.
3. (if approved) `apply_access(..., publish=false)` to dry-run, then `publish=true` once the admin toggle
   is on.

With the **Autopilot (lab demo)** preset on (Settings → Access automation logic), steps 1–3 collapse into a
single turn: one sentence ending “…and publish the changes” resolves, applies **and** publishes.

On the **Dynamic Layers** rail the shape is similar:

> "Add a rule allowing 10.1.1.222 to reach 10.2.0.0/16 over https in the web-access dynamic layer, then
> push it to gw-edge."

1. `add_dynamic_rule("web-access", "10.1.1.222", "10.2.0.0/16", service="https")` → edits the layer in
   PolicyPilot.
2. `push_dynamic_layer("web-access", gateway="gw-edge", dry_run=true)` → validates without applying.
3. `push_dynamic_layer("web-access", gateway="gw-edge")` → live push, allowed once an admin turns on
   `mcp_allow_layer_push`. (Use `gateway="mock"` to demo without a real gateway.)

## 5b. QA battery

A standing set of one-sentence “…and publish” prompts that exercise **every** tool, outcome, and column —
the demo script and the regression check in one — lives in **[mcp-agent-qa.md](mcp-agent-qa.md)**. Run it
after any change to the engine or the MCP tools.

## 6. Status — validated live

Validated end-to-end against `mcp` SDK 1.28.0 (Streamable-HTTP): a request with no / wrong bearer → 401;
`initialize` → 200 (serverInfo "PolicyPilot"); `tools/list` → all tools; `tools/call coverage_lookup`
returns real data; `decide_access` with a bad server id returns its error inside the tool result (no
crash). The endpoint serves at **`/mcp`** (a bare `/mcp` 307-redirects to `/mcp/`; MCP clients, incl.
n8n, follow it preserving the POST). The mounted app's session-manager lifespan is run from the portal's
own lifespan (so you won't see "Task group is not initialized"). The SDK is declared in
`requirements.txt` (install resolves from Artifactory).
